    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic <strong>Italian</strong> dish renowned for its comforting layers of pasta, rich sauces, and melted cheese. Traditionally, it features wide, flat sheets of pasta interspersed with hearty fillings, such as ground meat or vegetables, and sauces like a robust tomato-based marinara or creamy béchamel. The layers are topped with generous amounts of mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan cheese, creating a golden, bubbly crust when baked. Herbs like basil and oregano often enhance its flavor, adding a fragrant, savory depth to every bite.</p>
    <p>This versatile dish has countless variations, ranging from vegetarian options packed with spinach and mushrooms to decadent versions with multiple cheeses and meats. It’s typically baked in a casserole dish until the layers meld together, creating a satisfying harmony of textures and flavors. Perfect for gatherings, lasagna is a crowd-pleaser that showcases the artistry of Italian cuisine while offering comfort and warmth in every serving.</p>
